# PANTEL
PANTEL (Python based virtual assistant) is an open source project that allows command line shortcuts and complex command-based interfaces.

This project is designed to be gradually improved and developed by community, making libraries to add functionalities, and easily modifying the main product to adjust for added libraries. The basic format for a library is shown in this "notesLib.py" example, though any format could be easily applied. Anyone is free to fork, change, and modify the main product as well as create and publish libraries.

To run as an interface, type in the terminal:
python pantel.py

To run a single command, type:
python pantel.py <command>
* note: when running a single command replace all '$' with '*'.

To run any of the current libraries, simply type:
python <library name> install
at the libraries directory.

To view all commands type:
show commands
in the pantel.py interface.

For the future, this project may be implemented in javascript for wider accessibility and HTML-5 voice input options.
Enjoy!
